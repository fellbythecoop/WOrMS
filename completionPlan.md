US1.2.4: Build frontend UI for technicians to update their assigned work order statuses.
US1.2.5: Implement WebSocket real-time updates for work order status changes, notifying relevant users (requester, assigned technician, admin).
E1.3: Basic Asset Management

US1.3.1: Develop Asset entity/schema in PostgreSQL (ID, name, description, location, associated work orders).
US1.3.2: Create NestJS API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating assets.
US1.3.3: Build basic frontend UI for managing assets (list, detail view, create form).
US1.3.4: Link assets to work orders in the work order creation/edit flow.
Phase 2: Advanced Features & Integrations (Weeks 9-14)
Goal: Enhance core functionalities and introduce crucial integrations for better management.

Key Technical Considerations:

Robust authorization logic for various roles.
Efficient search and filtering.
File storage integration (on-premise storage solution).
Epics:

E2.1: Advanced User Management & Authorization

US2.1.1: Refine RBAC: Implement granular permissions for each role (e.g., Technician can only update their work orders, Admin can update any).
US2.1.2: Build an admin UI for viewing and managing user roles (only for Admin role).
US2.1.3: Implement API security checks based on user roles and permissions for all endpoints.
E2.2: Work Order Details & Comments

US2.2.1: Enhance WorkOrder schema with fields for notes, attachments, and resolution details.
US2.2.2: Create Comment entity/schema (linked to WorkOrder, user, timestamp).
US2.2.3: Develop NestJS APIs for adding and retrieving comments for a specific work order.
US2.2.4: Build frontend UI for adding and displaying comments on work order detail page (real-time updates via WebSockets).
US2.2.5: Implement file upload capabilities for work order attachments (e.g., images, documents), storing them on a designated on-premise file storage (e.g., network share accessible by the backend, or a minio instance if going with S3-compatible).
